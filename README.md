# Hi there, I'm Omer Levi! 🇮🇱 👋

### 🚀 Junior DevOps Engineer | 🧠 3 Years of Project Management Experience
I am a technical problem-solver who speaks both "Code" and "Business." After 3 years of leading cross-functional teams and managing complex lifecycles as a Project Manager, I am now applying that strategic mindset to **Infrastructure as Code**, **Automation**, and **Cloud Reliability**.
